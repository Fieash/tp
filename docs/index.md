**NeuroSync: All-In-One App for Psychiatrists!**

NeuroSync is a powerful, user-friendly desktop application that helps psychiatrists to keep track of patientsâ€™ contacts, details and notes from their sessions. No more searching through thick files of paper, just search by name and get everything you need in seconds.

* If you are interested about developing NeuroSync, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
